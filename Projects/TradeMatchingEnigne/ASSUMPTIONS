Assumption 1:
    Internally to avoid from std::string for T1,T2,T3,... Ids are stored in unsigned integers.

Assumption 2:
    Since there is no condition in the documentation about absence of invalid orders such as T50 B 0 10 or T47 S 0 50, T36 K 50 50, etc, the vailidity flag is needed to refine valid orders.

Assumption 3:
    There are two internal data structures for storing orders, std::map and absl::btree_map.

Assumption 4:
    The program needs following inputs: <executable> <number of orders(>=2)> <internal data structure type(std::map|btree_map)> <debug mode(0|1)>. 
    Last two arguments are defualted. Please provide correct arguments for proper execution. 
    You can provide your own input in "input.txt" file, otherwise the file with that name will be generated with the number of orders provided.
